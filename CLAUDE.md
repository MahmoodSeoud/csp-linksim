# CLAUDE.md

## gstack

- Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for **all** web browsing.
- **Never** use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

### Teammate setup

This project requires gstack (team mode). Two files are committed to enforce it:
`.claude/settings.json` registers a `PreToolUse` hook on the `Skill` tool, and
`.claude/hooks/check-gstack.sh` runs it — blocking any skill until gstack is
installed at `~/.claude/skills/gstack`.

Each developer installs gstack once ([bun](https://bun.sh) required):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team
```

### Available gstack skills

`/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/setup-gbrain`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/document-generate`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`

## DISCO-2 payload access

For reaching the DISCO-2 payload from the ground, read the local playbook at
`~/thesis/DISCO2-Payload-Playbook.md`. It is sensitive: do not commit it, quote from
it, or describe its mechanism in any repo or public output.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec

## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)
<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->

GBrain is set up and synced on this machine. The agent should prefer gbrain
over Grep when the question is semantic or when you don't know the exact
identifier yet.

**This worktree is pinned to a worktree-scoped code source** via the
`.gbrain-source` file in the repo root (kubectl-style context).
`gbrain code-def`, `code-refs`, `code-callers`, `code-callees`, `search`, and
`query` from anywhere under this worktree route to that source by default —
no `--source` flag needed (gbrain >= 0.41.38.0; on older gbrain the call-graph
commands need `--source "$(cat .gbrain-source)"`). Conductor sibling worktrees
of the same repo each have their own pin and their own indexed pages, so
semantic results match the code on disk here.

Call-graph queries (`code-callers`/`code-callees`) also need the graph to be
built first — run `/sync-gbrain --dream` (or `--full`) if they return
`count: 0`. This only works if this source's gbrain schema pack extracts code
symbols; on a non-code-aware pack `--dream` completes but the graph stays empty
and reports a WARN. `code-def`/`code-refs` need the same extraction.

Two indexed corpora available via the `gbrain` CLI:
- This worktree's code (auto-pinned via `.gbrain-source`).
- `~/.gstack/` curated memory (registered as `gstack-brain-<user>` source via
  the existing federation pipeline).

Prefer gbrain when:
- "Where is X handled?" / semantic intent, no exact string yet:
    `gbrain search "<terms>"` or `gbrain query "<question>"`
- "Where is symbol Y defined?" / symbol-based code questions:
    `gbrain code-def <symbol>` or `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`
- "What calls Y?" / "What does Y depend on?":
    `gbrain code-callers <symbol>` / `gbrain code-callees <symbol>`
- "What did we decide last time?" / past plans, retros, learnings:
    `gbrain search "<terms>" --source gstack-brain-<user>`

Grep is still right for known exact strings, regex, multiline patterns, and
file globs. Run `/sync-gbrain` after meaningful code changes; for ongoing
auto-sync across all worktrees, run `gbrain autopilot --install` once per
machine — gbrain's daemon handles incremental refresh on a schedule.

Safety: don't run `/sync-gbrain` while `gbrain autopilot` is active — the
orchestrator refuses destructive source ops when it detects a running autopilot
to avoid racing it (#1734). Prefer registering user repos with `gbrain sources
add --path <dir>` (no `--url`): URL-managed sources can auto-reclone, and the
sync code walk for them requires an explicit `--allow-reclone` opt-in.
